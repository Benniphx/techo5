// State is what a turn looks like from outside: which phase it is in and the words so far. It is
// what a screen shows — "Listening…", then what was heard, then the answer — and it is a hook
// rather than a query because a screen wants to redraw the moment something changes, not poll.
//
// Phase is the conversation's own name for it: idle, listening, thinking, replying. Heard and Reply
// are kept through the idle that follows a turn, so whoever shows them can let them linger.
